Dataset The dataset is publicly available from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning repository. This repository contains many free, public data sets from which models can be trained and developed. The set which I used for this project is titled ‘Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set’ It contains roughly 100,000 encounters with diabetes patients over a 9 year period. There is no identifiable information from this dataset, and it comes from 130 hospitals around the US.
